## Hi there, I'm Pritish Arora ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am a Data Engineer with hands-on experience in building scalable ETL pipelines, data marts, and frameworks for real-time/batch streaming. With expertise in cloud platforms like AWS and Azure (Databricks), I focus on architecting data solutions that drive business growth and operational efficiency. Currently pursuing my master's in Data Science, I have worked on impactful projects at Tesla and Persistent Systems.




I am passionate about designing robust data infrastructure and automating complex data workflows. Open to opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in data engineering to solve challenging problems.

### Key Projects

#### **Twitter Follower Triangle - MapReduce Project**
Analyzed a social amplifier triangle on Twitter, counting distinct triangles (X, Y, Z) where X follows Y, Y follows Z, and Z follows X. Implemented in Hadoop MapReduce, the project handled real-world Big Data challenges to ensure an exact triangle count.

#### **[NLP-Powered Story Generator](https://github.com/pritisharora55/NLP-Powered-Story-Generator)**
Explored the potential of NLP to generate original short stories. Using advanced techniques, the model predicts the next word in a sentence to generate engaging narratives. This project demonstrates how technology and creativity can intersect, assisting writers with overcoming writer's block or inspiring new ideas.

#### **[Forex Data Pipeline](https://github.com/pritisharora55/Forex-Data-Pipeline)**
A fully functional data pipeline orchestrated using Airflow to fetch forex data from an HTTP API and store it in Hive tables. Integrated logging and monitoring with Slack and email notifications. Used Spark for distributed processing and HDFS for storage.

#### **[Movie Reservation System](https://github.com/pritisharora55/Movie_reservation_system)**
Developed a full-fledged movie reservation system with features for both admins and customers. The system covers data collection, SQL querying, and analytics reports to display theatre statistics, with an interactive interface built using Python.
